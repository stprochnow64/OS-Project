===================================

OK, this time, fer sure....

This is a very good idea!  I like the fact that you are going to
integrate your modification with other commands.  Particularly, the
"history" command keeps a log for the user in the local directory.
You can see that with the "ls -al" command that shows "hidden" files
that start with a dot.  You'll see a file named ".bash_history" and
you can probably exploit that for your purposes.


Project approved.  Good work and good luck!

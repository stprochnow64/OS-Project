1.1 – Description of modification/addition to Linux

1.2 – Rationale as to why this is a good idea, or what the good points of it are

1.3 – Preliminary list of [possible] Linux modules that will be modified/affected

1.4 – Preliminary list of any new modules that you will produce [or 'Not Applicable' if there are none]

1. We are going to add a new command called horoscope that takes in the user's birthday or their astrological sign and outputs their horoscope. If the user gives their birthday, their sign will have to be computed in order to return the corresponding horoscope.
2. This is a good idea because it is a fun addition to the command line. We were inspired by the date command that gives the user the power to see a lot of information about the current date and time depending on what that currently is. With the horoscope command, depending on their birthdate, we can give them more information about themselves, which is fun!
3. This would not necessarily affect any other modules, but it could affect the date module if we decide to make it part of the date module instead of a new command that is separate from it.
4. horoscope (the only one so far)

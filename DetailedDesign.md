# 2.1 - List of Modules Modified/Affected

We will be modifing the *w* module. The *w* command relies on a few other modules which we may need to modify as well. These modules inclue *history, who, uptime,* and *ps*. The main module modified will be *w* though because the bulk of our project will be making sure that the *w* command displays information more clearly than it does now. We are not necessarily changing the information that is displays, but instead are changing how the information is displayed.
